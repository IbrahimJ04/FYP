# Overview
st.markdown("""
This interactive web application focusses on simulating and exploring **biological pattern formation** through the **Gierer‚ÄìMeinhardt model**, a classic framework for modelling **activator‚Äìinhibitor dynamics** in developmental biology.

### üéØ Aim of the Project

The primary aim of this project is to:

> **Investigate the dynamics and pattern-forming capabilities of the Gierer‚ÄìMeinhardt system**, both with and without spatial diffusion, by examining multiple model variants. Through numerical simulations, we aim to identify conditions under which the system exhibits steady states, oscillations, or spatial pattern formation ‚Äî with a focus on the emergence of Turing instability.

### üìò Background

The **Gierer‚ÄìMeinhardt model** describes interactions between:

- **Activator (A)** ‚Äì promotes its own production and that of the inhibitor.
- **Inhibitor (H)** ‚Äì suppresses the activator.

These interactions, coupled with spatial diffusion, can lead to the emergence of **spatial patterns**, such as those observed in animal skin or plant structures.

### üìê Gierer‚ÄìMeinhardt Model Variants

#### GM 1 ‚Äì Basic System
$$
\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} = D_A \\nabla^2 A - A + \\frac{A^2}{H}
$$
$$
\\tau \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 H - \\mu H + A^2
$$

#### GM 2 ‚Äì With Activator Saturation
$$
\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} = D_A \\nabla^2 A - A + \\frac{A^2}{H(1 + k A^2)}
$$
$$
\\tau \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 H - \\mu H + A^2
$$

#### GM 3 ‚Äì With Constant Activator Production
$$
\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} = D_A \\nabla^2 A - A + \\frac{A^2}{H} + c
$$
$$
\\tau \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 H - \\mu H + A^2
$$

> For simulations **without diffusion**, the spatial Laplacian terms ($$ D_A \\nabla^2 A $$ and $$ D_H \\nabla^2 H $$) are omitted.
